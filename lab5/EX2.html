    Hello
    <div id="Kids">
        <script>

            var X = 2;
            var age = 20;
            var NumberOfKids = "I would like to have " + X + " kids";

            
            document.getElementById("Kids").innerHTML = NumberOfKids;
        </script>
        
        <script>

            
            NumberOfKids = "I would like to have " + X*age + " kids";
            //Putting X*age within Number of kids, saves rewriting the orignal X=2 to store the new absurd value. So in consoles I can check what is x, and console will tell me 2, same thing for age
            
            document.getElementById("Kids").innerHTML = NumberOfKids;

        </script>
